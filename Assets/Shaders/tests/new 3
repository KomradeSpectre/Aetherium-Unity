Good Note - I accidently deleted a basalt tile under them after trapping them in a small wall of Lavaland Wall for a joke. Resulting in them getting hit with a lava tile. Being near death they dropped immedietly and I was too slow to heal them, or throw them clear of the Aux Landing Zone. Gibbing their body, ruining their round as a Miner. They DCed while I tried to make amends for my stupid mistake. Contacted them in DMs and they said it's all good. +1 for chill attitude for dealing with a TA's dumb mistake.

As a captain during round 114811, authorized security to kill all unimplanted crew during revolutionaries, making multiple announcements across a time span informing the staff that if they were not implanted they would get killed. This lead to multiple innocent people dying at security hands, being dragged out of their departments to die in brig. The revs didn't had an advantage at this point, so this was an excessive measure to deal with them; TheMythicGhost got explained why this was wrong concerning this specific round and accepted the blame.

Declare a silicon as rogue when it flashed them after they attacked a human infront of it, the human was a clown with a clown car and they declared them as rogue over this. Told this violates rule 1 of silicon protections:"Declarations of the silicons as rogue over inability or unwillingness to follow invalid or conflicting orders is a violation of Server Rule 1. The occurrence of such an attempt should be adminhelped and then disregarded. ". Given a chance, due to the speedy revival of the borg and to remind them that this policy exists to protect silicons from being called rogue over following asimov laws. Order the silicons to listen to you and don't harm a human in the future if you want them to assist you.

During round ID 102086 broke into the brig during an ongoing conflict. Assumed that the detective attacking people, who had broken in previously, had no reason to do so. Claimed that the detective was a "fake" and a ling who had killed the real detective, which ended up with the detective's death at someone elses hands. Warned not to jump to conclusions and lie. Next time something like this happens it will result in a ban.

Banned for 800 minutes - As a scientist, had themselves promoted to the HoS. A blob destroyed the armory and they called the shuttle because it wasn't going to be fixed. It was fixed, yet they continued to try to call the shuttle with reasons such as ", "We are leaving, if I find out who is recalling, they will be executed on sight.""As I said, we are leaving.". You also walked up and straight up executed a guy for recalling the shuttle, rather than taking any of the possible actions such as jail or even taking away his all access.

Warned about infinite disposal loops. Seemed to think they were on the same level as other pranks, informed they're treated a fair bit more seriously since they're correspondingly shittier. I doubt it'll happen again.

After stealing from a crew-member, they deathbolted someone who began to pursue them for their theft. Only kept to a warning because they have no bad history with overescalation and the person was nearly immediately revived by them. Player was heavily warned about following proper escalation in the future.
